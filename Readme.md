# Hacker News Clone

This project is a full-stack that clones the functionality of Hacker News, using Django as the backend framework and React as the frontend. The 
aim of this project is to allow a user navigate to the web page of their likes and perform relevant create, update, retrieve and delete operations as far as the site is concerned.  It uses a powerful
python message task queue consumer called Celery. Other important tools we used to ensure scalability, high performance, robust and testable application are Redux, Celery Beat, PostgreSQL, Pytest, Jest, Requests and Django RestFramework.
